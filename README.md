📊 About the Dataset – Heart Disease Prediction

❤️ Context
This dataset is designed to help predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various medical attributes.
It is sourced from publicly available medical data (such as the Cleveland dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository) and is widely used in healthcare-based machine learning and data science projects 🏥🤖.

The dataset contains clinical and demographic information about patients and is commonly used for binary classification tasks – predicting whether a patient has heart disease or not 💓.

📦 Content
Each record represents a single patient and includes attributes related to age, blood pressure, cholesterol, electrocardiogram results, and more.

🧾 Feature Descriptions
🎂 age: Age of the patient (in years)

🚻 sex: Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)

💓 cp (chest pain type):
  - 0: Typical angina
  - 1: Atypical angina
  - 2: Non-anginal pain
  - 3: Asymptomatic

💉 trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)

🍔 chol: Serum cholesterol (in mg/dl)

🍬 fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)

📉 restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results
  - 0: Normal
  - 1: ST-T wave abnormality
  - 2: Left ventricular hypertrophy

🏃 thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved

💨 exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)

📉 oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise compared to rest

📈 slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0, 1, 2)

🔬 ca: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0 to 3)

🧬 thal: Thalassemia
  - 1: Normal
  - 2: Fixed defect
  - 3: Reversible defect

🏷️ target: Indicates the presence of heart disease
  - 0: No heart disease
  - 1: Heart disease present ✅

🎯 Target Variable
target: Binary classification — 1 if the patient has heart disease, 0 if not.

🧠 Use Cases
This dataset is perfect for practicing:

✅ Logistic Regression

It's a great real-world example of applying machine learning in healthcare to predict critical medical conditions and assist in early diagnosis 💡.
